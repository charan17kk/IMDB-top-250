📌 IMDB Top 250 Web Scraper + BigQuery Pipeline
🎯 Objective

This project scrapes the IMDB Top 250 Movies data and builds a small data pipeline that:

Extracts movie details (Rank, Title, Year, Rating, URL).

Saves the data locally (CSV/JSON).

Loads the structured data into Google BigQuery.

⚙️ Approach

Scraping

Used requests + BeautifulSoup to fetch the IMDB Top 250 page.

Parsed HTML to extract required fields for each movie.

Stored results into a Pandas DataFrame.

Local Storage

Exported the DataFrame into movies.csv for portability.

BigQuery Loading

Created a dataset (imdb_dataset) and table (top_250_movies) in BigQuery.

Used google-cloud-bigquery Python client to upload CSV data.

Defined schema:

rank → INT

title → STRING

year → INT

rating → FLOAT

url → STRING

🚀 How to Run
1️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run scraper
python scraper.py


➡ Generates movies.csv

3️⃣ Load into BigQuery
python load_to_bq.py


Make sure your Google Cloud credentials are set:

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/service_account.json"

⚡ Challenges & Solutions

Dynamic page structure → Verified HTML tags using Developer Tools to avoid scraping errors.

BigQuery schema mismatch → Explicitly cast data types (int, float) before upload.

Authentication → Used a service account JSON key for secure access.

✅ Deliverables

scraper.py → Extracts and saves IMDB data.

load_to_bq.py → Uploads CSV to BigQuery.

movies.csv → Sample extracted dataset.

BigQuery table: imdb_dataset.top_250_movies
